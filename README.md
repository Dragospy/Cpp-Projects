This is a collection of the C++ Projects I have/will create whilst learning the language.

List of projects and their description:
  * Denary to binary converter - Pretty self explanatory
  * Login and Register system - A basic login and register system, that saves user data into a file, the file name is the name of the user and the contents is their password.
